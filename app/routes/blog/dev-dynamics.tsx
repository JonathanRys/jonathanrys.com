        Honesty and integrity are important pieces of the developer experience.
        If we don't have these things, we end up with a culture where developers
        are afraid to make mistakes and so they learn very slowly. When we do
        this, we're trading innovation for humiliation and that doesn't sound
        like a good deal to me.
