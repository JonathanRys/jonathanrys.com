        Many companies think they can adopt a few Agile ceremonies, start using
        a Kanban board, and call themselves Agile. But these things don't make
        you Agile. Being Agile means being able to respond to change quickly.
        That doesn't mean last minute changes are suddenly OK or that developers
        can be tossed around a bit more. Agile is a process improvement
        framework that uses tight feedback loops to inform all members of the
        team of impending dangers or deficiencies within the team quickly. Agile
        requires honesty, openness, and transparency by everyone involved
        (especially management) or it won't work.
